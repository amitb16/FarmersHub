# FarmersHub
FarmersHub â€“ The Only Helper of Farmers is an Android mobile application designed to bridge the critical information gap in India's agricultural sector. Developed using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio, the app delivers a simplified digital platform for farmers, especially in rural areas with limited access to high-end devices and reliable internet. It provides real-time crop prices, government scheme updates, farming best practices, and nearby market locations using GPS. By integrating open APIs, modern UI/UX practices, and lightweight architecture, FarmersHub empowers Indian farmers to make data-driven decisions, adopt modern methods, and improve productivity and income. The project aligns with India's digital agriculture mission, promoting inclusivity, transparency, and rural upliftment.
